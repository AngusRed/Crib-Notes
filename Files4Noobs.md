## File types and me? 

I am going to try my best to explain my own experiences with various file types

First up, TAR!

#TAR Files  

## TAR Files

<-xf` = Extract File  

` #!/bin/bash  

for i in {1000..0}  
  do  
    tar -xf "$i.tar"  
  done>  
  
**The above runs a loop extraction**  

`rm *(file type)` = Removes all files in a directory by file name type  

## PCAP  

PCAP = Packet Capture. Basically a PCAP is a digital representation of packets of information being sent and received over the net....i think.
