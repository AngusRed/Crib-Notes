`pwd` = print working directory

`setgid` = Set rights to group files in a set directory

`dmesg` - ring buffer log  

Systemdâ€™s journal also stores multiple logs (stdout/stderr output of daemons, syslog messages,
kernel logs) and makes it easy to query them with journalctl. Without any arguments, it just
dumps all the available logs in a chronological way.   
With the `-r` option, it will reverse the order so that newer messages are shown first.   
With the `-f` option, it will continuously print new log entries as they are appended to its database.   
The `-u` option can limit the messages to those emitted by a specific systemd unit (ex: `journalctl -u ssh.service`).  

`-v` =   
`lsdev` =

## Changing Username from Default "Kali" and your Default password "kali", also Date/Time (DTG)

The easiest way is to create a new user with `$ sudo adduser YourChoiceUsername`  

To change a username in an existing/running machine the cmd is 

`$ sudo usermod -l YourChoice kaliDefault`  This usually will return something about a process running and a number. You can run another command to kill that process but then your kali will shutdown.

Thanks to @rogan and @InitRoot From #HackSouth we now know how to change it.

Manually reboot or in your command line run  
`$ sudo reboot`  

When the reboot starts, hit `F3`, this will take you to `initroot` so basically like the bios. In there, you will run the same command as above, and it should work.  

`$ sudo usermod -l YourChoice kaliDefault`  
Once thats done run `sudo reboot`  

When you then log in use your new username. Should work! So now you are back in your kali. You need to change your root user now.  

It started with `$  kali@kali`  
Then you changed it to `$ YourChoice@kali`  
Now we want to make it `$ YourChoice@YourChoice`  

In your command line run:  

To see what your details are run `$ cat /etc/hosts`  

`$  nano /etc/hosts`  nano brings up a GUI. In there you use up/down/left/right arrows to go to the `hostname` that says kali. You will manually change it to whatever you want. Next we need to change the hostname. To test that you are half way run `$  pwd` It will take a few seconds.  

Next run `$ nano /etc/hostname` in there, change the name in the gui. To test success you can run `$  Reboot` or open a new Terminal and run `$ pwd`, this should be almost instant cause you have resolved

Next we need to change your password, this is USUALLY easier than the above. The command is:  

`$  sudo passwd`  
Enter new PW
Retype new PW
Success/Failure  

**DTG**

`$  sudo  date -s "11/20/2003 12:00:00"`
